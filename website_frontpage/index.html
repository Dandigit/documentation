    <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Update: standard C library support <font size="1" color="grey">(2015-11-18 by Bas vd Berg)</font></h1></div>
    <div class="contentText">
    After a lot of discussions, brainstorming and implementation, C2C now supports
    the standard C library. This feature is the first in a series that will grow to
    full C library support and C2 library support! Since C2 doesn't use the header-#include
    mechanism, support of libraries had to be re-throught. The full solution is described
    under <a href="site/build_system/libraries/">Documentation</a>.

    <div class="contentTitle"><h1>First tooling: c2tags <font size="1" color="grey">(2015-10-18 by Bas vd Berg)</font></h1></div>
    <div class="contentText">
    This summer C2 had a brief appearance on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10061487">Hacker News</a>.
    One comment was that with a new language, you lose existing tooling. In my opinion,
    one problem of C/C++ is the existence of good tooling, since the language makes writing
    tools quite hard. During programming you only need a few main language tools besides
    the compiler and editor:
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li><b>indexer</b> (eg. ctags/cscope) to be able to 'jump to definition'</li>
        <li><b>formatter</b> (eg. astyle) to format the code</li>
        <li><b>navigator</b> to quickly navigate sources</li>
        <li><b>checkers</b> to perform extra checks the compiler lacks (eg. cppcheck, lint, etc)</li>
    </ul><br>
    So I'm very pround to finally introduce <b>c2tags</b>. This tool allows editors to easily
    <i>jump to definition</i>.
    c2tags reads a <i>refs</i> file that can be generated by the c2compiler. Since it's
    generated by the compiler itself, it is complete and correct.
    <b>c2tags</b> is supplemented by a small Vim config-fragment to be usable. Since the
    compiler is <i>smart</i>, the matching doesn't have to be done by string matching to
    find a real match, but simply asking the compiler where a reference points to.<br><br>

    For the next part, I'm working on a <i>refactor engine</i>, that allows smart-renaming and
    moving of functions/types/globals in/between files. <b>c2reto</b> currently already has
    the ability to show all dependencies between global declarations and files. In combination
    with the refactor engine, it would allow drag-n-drop moving of global declarations. I
    can't wait to see this in action!

    <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Update: Documentation live! <font size="1" color="grey">(2015-08-05 by Bas vd Berg)</font></h1></div>
    <div class="contentText">
    After a period of silence, it's time for an update! Work has started on c2reto, C2's refactor tool. This
    tool can be used to show the architecture of a program and do some refactoring, like renaming and
    moving global declarations. The C2 intrastructure has also been rebased on LLVM/Clang 3.6 to bring
    the latest in compiler building blocks. And last, but not least, C2 now has some awesome
    documentation thanks to Mkdocs! It can be found under 'Documentation' on the top bar.

    <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Third rebase <font size="1" color="grey">(2014-11-20 by Bas vd Berg)</font></h1></div>
    <div class="contentText">
    The C2 compilers is based both on LLVM and on Clang. This is a great platform to build a compiler on.
    The first C2 compiler was based on version 3.2 of both and today marks the next step as it's now
    rebased on 3.5. This brings a newer C standard and more checks. I would like to thank both the Clang
    and LLVM team for their great effort!

    <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Working on the parser <font size="1" color="grey">(2014-07-24 by Bas vd Berg)</font></h1></div>
    <div class="contentText">
    The C2 compiler is not fully complete yet, but some parts are finally nearing something that is almost
    close to nearly done. The Parser component is one of those. With the addition of parsing of Array and
    Field Designator Inits (.x = 10, [10] = 2, etc), only a few things remain, namely casts and bitfields.
    Follow the discussion on the forum if you're interested.

    <div class="contentTitle"><h1>generating dependencies <font size="1" color="grey">(2014-05-12 by Bas vd Berg)</font></h1></div>
    <div class="contentText">
    One advantage of having no header files, is that symbols (functions, variables, etc) are only defined in one place.
    This allows tools to generate good dependencies. In language with header files, it's always the question of where to place
    the dependency: the header, the c-file or both? In C2, the compiler can generate a full-dependency file. No other tools
    are needed and the results can be trusted. If you're interested in some of the results, check the
    <a href="http://www.c2lang.org/forum/index.php?topic=26.0">forum post</a>.

    <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Type-system update <font size="1" color="grey">(2014-03-15 by Bas vd Berg)</font></h1></div>
    <div class="contentText">
    Checking types in a C-like language is not very straightforward. A lot of weird things and
    a lot of decisions to make. So it took me almost 6 months to finish the update I push today.
    This update of 155 patches enables the type checking system to check integer literals and
    built-in types completely. Floating points and pointer stuff only has rudimentary checking, but that's a lot easier
    now the basic system is in place. So hopefully that'll only take a month or so..<br><br>

    If you're interested in the capabilities, the best place to look is the unit-tests directory (test/)
    and for discussions, check the forum.

    <div class="contentTitle"><h1>A New Year.. <font size="1" color="grey">(2014-01-01 by Bas vd Berg)</font></h1></div>
    <div class="contentText">
    In a few days, the C2C GitHub archive celebrates its first birthday. Looking back at the past year,
    C2C has reached some milestones:
    <ul>
    <li>Parsing most of the code into the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
    <li>Analyser is 70% finished, detects lots of errors (eg. unused types/struct fields)
    <li>Compiling Hello World to LLVM IR
    <li>Working IR generation of multi-package programs
    <li>Working IR generation of multi-file packages
    <li>Can generate Ansi-C code from C2 code
    <li>Working unit-test framework for Analyser/Parser
    <li>Re-based on LLVM/Clang 3.3
    </ul>
    So it's definately possible to develop some C2 code and use c2c to check it. This should give
    a feeling of developing in C2. Looking forward to 2014, plans include:
    <ul>
    <li type=circle>More IR generation (while, for, etc)
    <li type=circle>Support external (C/C2) libraries
    <li type=circle>Implement generic compiler attributes
    <li type=circle>Create c2reto graphical refactor tool
    <li type=circle>Compile LLVM IR code into binary
    </ul>
    I especially like the c2reto tool, since it allows drag 'n drop reordering of functions, types and variables
    in and between files. It will also show dependencies between packages.

    <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Implementing C2 (part 2)  <font size="1" color="grey">(2013-09-07 by Bas vd Berg)</font></h1></div>
    <div class="contentText">
    Looking at the frequency of these posts, you'd think work on C2 stopped. Nothing could be
    further from the truth. The Github archive is steadily growing. Most recently was the complete
    rewrite of the Type system and the addition of a test framework. With these two things in place
    the Parser and Semantic Analysers will definitely get more mature.
    The current state is that the Parser is almost parsing the full syntax (there are just some cornercases
    and some error handling left). The Analyser is detecting a lot of errors already; next on the list is
    detection of unused Types/Functions/Vars and uninitialized variables.
    The C-code generator is basically working, but doesn't produce correct C code a 100% of the time. The
    IR code generator is still in it's infancy. The AST (abstract syntax tree) does hold all the information it
    needs, so nothing is blocking there except time to implement.
    If you have any ideas/questions please use the forum. Happy hacking!

    After the Fosdem presentation, the GitHub archive got 40+ followers, so I think that
    part was succesfull. I wanted to get more functionaly in as soon as possible after that.
    The biggest feature that entered the stage was code analysis; checking for errors/warnings
    in the code. This part really worked out well I think. It's in no way finished, but the
    basis is there. I was able to re-use a lot of Clang functionality for this (Great job
    guys!). Additionally there have been many minor changes (changing the package operator
    from :: to . (dot), etc).
    The next big thing will be type checking (eg int a = "hello";) and after that
    the real code-generation can begin. I haven't looked into LLVM IR code generation beyond
    a few hello-worlds, so any help translating the AST to the LLVM IR code is welcome.
    If you're interested, follow the forum or the Git archive.

    <div class="contentText">
    My proposal for a 15 minute lightningtalk at Fosdem '13 has been accepted!
    Because I want to have this website and Git archive ready by then, I have some
    work to do.
    I also started working even more on C2 since then. The current state of it is than it
    parses almost the full syntax and translates a subset into the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
    I just started on code generation. For those wanting to read more about the language, I've
    added a PDF design document (in the top bar under Design). Hopefully my lightning-talk
    will spark the interest of some fellow developers...

    <div class="contentTitle"><h1>The beginning...  <font size="1" color="grey">(2013-01-04 by Bas vd Berg)</font></h1></div>
    <div class="contentText">
    In the beginning of June 2012, I was looking (as always) for a new pet-project. I wanted
    to create my own compiler for a long time, but the effort always seemed to big and the
    goal never really worthy. Then I got an idea to improve C, because I really like that
    language, but found the header files bothersome. After writing some compiler mockups of
    my own, I found out that parsing C is really hard. So I started playing around with
    llvm/clang and suddenly, and the whole effort of writing a compiler looked much easier.
    So I started modifying clang to re-use its Lexer and C2 was born.
